"""
Task 1: Your Mood Tracker-- Simulate a mood tracker that records your mood at three different times of the day (morning, afternoon, evening) for each day of the week. Use nested loops to implement this: the outer loop should iterate over the days, and the inner loop should iterate over the times of the day. For each time, randomly select a mood from a predefined list and print it. Use the random module again to randomly select the mood.

Example Outcome: An example would be "On Tuesday afternoon you were sad" "On Tuesday night you were happy" "On Wednesday morning you were tired"
